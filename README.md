# Chicago-Crime---SQL
This project analyzes data on Chicago crimes, Public schools in Chicago , and socioeconomics data of Chicago to understand the relationships between these factors.


**PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT & OBJECTIVE.**

Understand the relationships between crime rates, socioeconomic factors, and educational opportunities in Chicago.

Implement the full cycle of database management, including design, implementation, querying, and analysis.

**OBJECTIVE**

The objective of the project aims to understand the complex relationship between crime, poverty, and educational outcomes in Chicago. The project will analyze data from Chicago Crime, Chicago Public Schools, and Chicago Socioeconomic Data to:

# Identify high-crime areas and their socioeconomic characteristics.

# Analyze the impact of poverty and socioeconomic disparities on crime rates.

# Explore the relationship between school safety, performance, and community crime rates.

# Implement the full cycle of database management, including design, implementation, querying, and analysis.

The objective is to gain valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation to improve public safety and educational outcomes in Chicago.

__**Analysis**__:

**Socioeconomic Landscape Insights**

This section focuses on understanding the economic conditions of different areas and identifying key disparities.

1. Areas with the Highest Percentage of Households Below Poverty (Chart 1)

• Finding: Riverdale (56.5%), Fuller Park (51.2%), and Englewood (46.6%) are the areas with the highest percentages of households living below the poverty line.
• Implication: These neighborhoods are severely impacted by poverty and need targeted economic assistance and programs.

2. Average Hardship Index and Income for Each Community Area (Chart 2)

• Finding: Communities like Riverdale, Fuller Park, and North Lawndale have very high hardship indices (above 90) and low average incomes (around $12,000—$l5,000 per year).

• Implication: A high hardship index highlights areas where economic struggles, poor housing, and unemployment are combined, requiring focused interventions.

3. Community Areas with High Unemployment and Low Education Levels (Chart 3)
• Finding: West Englewood, Fuller Park, and Riverdale have the highest unemployment rates (above 40%) and the lowest education levels, with many adults lacking a high school diploma.
• Implication: These areas face challenges in breaking out of poverty cycles due to limited access to education and job opportunities.

4. Relationship Between Income and Parent Engagement (Chart 4)
• Finding: Wealthier areas like Lincoln Park and Lake View have higher parent engagement in schools, while lower-income areas like Riverdale and West Englewood report very low parent involvement.
• Implication: Economic challenges limit parental involvement, which may affect school performance and outcomes for children in these areas.

SUMMARY :

This section shows big differences in living conditions across communities. Places with more poverty, lower incomes, higher unemployment, and less education face serious problems. These issues likely lead to higher crime, poorer health, and lower quality of life.

5. Crime Rates in Areas with Low Educational Attainment
• Finding: There is a strong correlation between areas with low educational attainment and higher crime rates.
• Implication:
This analysis explores the link between low education levels and crime rates. The query focuses on areas where more than 40% of adults lack a high school diploma. The results show that areas like Brighton Park and New City, with the highest crime counts (10 each), lead the list, followed by Lower West Side (9) and South Lawndale (8). These areas align with patterns observed earlier, where low education often accompanies high unemployment, low income, and high hardship indices. This connection suggests that educational barriers may contribute to higher crime rates, emphasizing the need for policies that improve education and create pathways to economic stability.

6. Crimes and Socioeconomic Status in Communities
• Finding: The types of crimes committed vary across communities with different socioeconomic statuses.
• Implication:

Areas with higher poverty rates tend to have higher occurrences of offenses like narcotics, theft, and assault.
Communities with lower poverty rates, like Chicago Lawn, show a higher proportion of property crimes such as criminal damage and trespass.
The distribution of crime types within communities can be quite diverse, suggesting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving crime in each area.

SUMMARY:

The dashboards demonstrate a clear link between socioeconomic factors and crime rates. Areas with lower educational attainment and higher poverty levels tend to experience higher crime rates, particularly those involving violent and drug-related offenses. However, the specific types of crimes vary across communities, indicating the need for tailored crime prevention and intervention strategies.

**Schools and Their Environment**

This segment focuses on the relationship between school performance, safety, and environmental factors.

8. Relationship Between Average ACT Scores and Safety Levels in High-Hardship Areas
(Chart 8)
• Finding: Schools in safer areas tend to have higher ACT scores. Although the correlation is mild, it suggests that safety contributes positively to academic outcomes.
• Implication: Enhancing safety in high-hardship areas could lead to better academic performance.

9. Schools in High-Poverty Areas and Their Performance (Chart 9)
• Finding: Schools located in areas with high poverty levels (e.g., Englewood, North Lawndale, West Garfield Park) struggle with performance issues.
• Implication: Correlations between poverty and school performance emphasize the need for targeted educational resources and programs in these areas.

SUMMARY:

This section highlights the importance of school safety in promoting academic achievement, particularly in high-hardship areas. Schools located in safer environments tend to have better academic outcomes. However, other factors, such as socioeconomic disparities and access to quality education, likely play a role in influencing school performance.

**Cross-Domain Insights**

This section integrates poverty, school proximity, and crime data to identify patterns.

10. Relationship Between Household Poverty Level and Crime Numbers (Chart 10)

• Finding: There is a positive correlation between the percentage of households below the poverty line and the count of crimes. Areas with higher poverty levels generally report higher crime rates.
• Implication: Socioeconomic factors, particularly poverty, significantly influence crime prevalence.

11. Crimes Near School Locations (Chart 11)
• Finding: Crimes such as robbery, narcotics violations, and burglary cluster near schools. The map highlights specific high-crime areas.
• Implication: The proximity of crimes to schools raises safety concerns for students, potentially impacting their academic performance and well-being.

12. Impact of Community Hardship Indea on Crime Arrests (Chart 12)
• Finding: Communities with lower hardship indices tend to have more arrests, indicating a complex relationship between socioeconomic factors and criminal activity.
• Implication: Interventions addressing the specific needs of low-hardship communities, such as improving law enforcement strategies or addressing underlying social issues, could potentially impact arrest rates.
13. Relationship Between Minority Percentage and Crime Occurrence (Chart 13)

• Finding: Areas with higher percentages of minority populations show varying crime occurrences. However, other factors like poverty and hardship may confound this relationship.
• Implication: Minority populations may face systemic challenges, but detailed multivariable analysis is needed to draw precise conclusions.

SUMMARY:

This segment underscores the complex relationship between crime, poverty, community hardship, and demographics. While poverty and hardship appear to be strong predictors of crime, the distribution of specific crime types suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding. The lack of a clear correlation between minority demographics and crime rates highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when analyzing crime patterns.
